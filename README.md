# Usage

Download signed APK from release page and install it, then open your quick panel, add the button called "Rotate screen". Click it to switch between landscape and portrait. For example, if you are in 90 degrees, it will rotate to 0 degress, and if you are in 180 degrees, it will rotate to 270 degrees.

When you click it for the first time, it will require the permission of change system settings, if the settings page does not show automatically, you can go to application settings and find "AZRotate" to enable the permission for it.

This only works when auto rotate is disabled, please disable it by yourself before clicking the button.
